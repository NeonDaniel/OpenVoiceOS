A minimalistic Linux OS bringing the open source voice assistant Mycroft A.I. to embbeded, low-spec headless and/or small (touch)screen devices.

## System.
### OpenVoiceOS - Full 64 Bit distribution
- Linux kernel 5.10.x (LTS)
- Buildroot 2021.02.x (LTS)
- Mycroft 20.08.x (mycroft-lib pip installable version)
- Raspberry Pi 3|3b|3b+ (Initial development hardware = 3b)
- Raspberry Pi 4 (Current development hardware)

## Getting started.
At this moment development is in very early stages and focussed on the Raspberry Pi 3B & 4. As soon as an initial first workable version
is created, other hardware might be added.

### Getting the code.
First, get the code on your system! The simplest method is via git.
<br>
- cd ~/
- git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/OpenVoiceOS.git
- cd OpenVoiceOS

### Patching Buildroot.
*(ONLY at the first clean checkout/clone)* If this is the very first time you are going to build an image, you need to execute the following command once;
<br>
- ./scripts/br-patches.sh
<br>
This will patch the Buildroot packages.

### Installing System Build Dependencies
The following system packages are required to build the image:
- gcc
- subversion
- qttools5-dev
- qttools5-dev-tools
- python

## Building the image.
Building the image(s) can be done by utilizing a proper Makefile;
<br>
To see the available commands, just run: 'make help'
<br>
As example to build the rpi4 version;<br>
- make clean
- make rpi4_64-gui-config
- make rpi4_64-gui

Now grab a cup of coffee, go for a walk, sleep and repeat as the build process takes up a long time pulling everything from source and cross compiling everything for the device. Especially the qtwebengine package is taking a LONG time.
<br>
(At the moment there is an outstanding issue which prevents the build to run completely to the end. The plasma-workspace package will error out, not finding the libGLESv4 properly linked within QT5GUI. When the build stopped bacause of this error, edit the following file;
<br><br>
buildroot/output/host/aarch64-buildroot-linux-gnu/sysroot/usr/lib/cmake/Qt5Gui/Qt5GuiConfigExtras.cmake
<br><br>
at the bottom of the file replace this line;
<br><br>
_qt5gui_find_extra_libs(OPENGL "GLESv2" "" "")
<br><br>And replace it bit this line;<br><br>
_qt5gui_find_extra_libs(OPENGL "${CMAKE_SYSROOT}/usr/lib/libGLESv2.so" "" "${CMAKE_SYSROOT}/usr/include/libdrm")
<br><br>
Then you can continue the build process by re-running the "make rpi4_64-gui" command. (DO NOT, run "make clean" and/or "make rpi4_64-gui-config" again, or you will start from scratch again !!!)
<br><br>
When everything goes fine the xz compressed image will be available within the release directory.
